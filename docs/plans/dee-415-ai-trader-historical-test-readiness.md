# DEE-415 — AI-TRADER: complete Historical-Test Readiness program (canonical integration plan)

> **Single canonical integration plan** for DEE-415 = ONE integration boundary containing 23 sequential work packages (`HTR-WP01..HTR-WP23`), implemented by Build-enabled child Cursor plans one at a time on the shared branch `dee-415-ai-trader-historical-test-readiness`, with a local commit after each work package, ONE final whole-program Opus audit, ONE PR to `dev`, and ONE Human squash merge. It is the **repository-first integration authority for DEE-415 after its first commit**. The `.cursor/plans/` parent controller and child plans are local execution/controller artifacts (mutable), not canonical authority.

## Authority and topology

- **Core invariant:** DEE-415 = one integration issue = one canonical integration plan (this file) = one primary branch (`dee-415-ai-trader-historical-test-readiness`) = one final PR = one Human merge event. The 23 implementation stages are **internal work packages**, not PR boundaries (`INTEGRATION-BOUNDARY-POLICY.md`: "Never split merely because a plan has several steps — those are work-packages inside one PR").
- **Parent controller (guidance/ledger):** `.cursor/plans/ai-trader_historical-test-readiness_master_20260711.plan.md` (rev 4, gitignored).
- **After first commit:** this canonical integration plan `state` + Linear DEE-415 + `git log` are authoritative; the scratch parent is a synchronized mirror.
- Only **one child plan** may be active at a time; only **one work package** may be implemented per Build session; all work packages use the **same branch**; each completed work package produces a **local commit**; **no child plan may open a PR**; only the final integration closeout (after HTR-WP23 + final Opus audit) prepares the **single final PR**.
- **Final PR prohibited** until all 23 work packages are COMPLETE, parent/canonical states synchronized, the full validation matrix is green, the readiness package exists, and Opus completes the final whole-program audit.

## Program goal

Bring AI-TRADER from `dev@f23c51e` to `READY_FOR_FULL_HISTORICAL_TEST` = a code-ready, Human-deployable Execution Server package (Option A). This is an infrastructure + epistemic-integrity qualification (make a full historical run trustworthy, reproducible, and self-scoring), **not** an edge/profitability verdict (ADR-0010). Out of scope: multi-year validation, walk-forward, blind holdout, edge verdict, Strategy Validation Gate approval, paper soak, live trading, real capital, deployed Execution Server qualification.

## Approved decisions (recorded)

`APPROVE-HTR-PROGRAM`; `APPROVE-HTR-ACTIVATION: research-only-org0` (D-14); `ACK-HTR-CORE: m1-closed` (D-15); `APPROVE-HTR-D13: htr-supersedes` (D-13); `APPROVE-HTR-RUNTIME-SUBSTRATE: deterministic-historical-readiness-substrate` (D-16); `APPROVE-HTR-TARGET-SUBSET: scoped-htr-ratification` (D-17); `APPROVE-HTR-D1: record-level-chain` (D-1); `APPROVE-HTR-EPISTEMIC-CLOSURE: record-level` (D-18); `APPROVE-HTR-EXECSERVER: option-a-code-ready` (D-19); `APPROVE-HTR-D10: divergence-register-v1` (D-10); `APPROVE-HTR-EXECUTION-TOPOLOGY: one-integration-issue-one-branch-one-final-pr-23-sequential-child-build-plans`. Activation boundary: Org-0 non-custodial research/historical only; no live, capital, holdout, external activation, agent authorization, gate opening, or Execution Server mutation. WP-local decisions D-11A/D-11B/D-2/D-4/D-5/D-12 stop at their owning work package's Human gate on the same branch.

## Supersession

Supersedes the B01-only canonical plan `docs/plans/dee-415-htr-b01-readiness-canon.md` (renamed into this whole-program plan). `.cursor/plans/ai-trader_intelligence_evolution_48358215.plan.md` is superseded as program authority (D-13), retained as historical/evidence source (not mutated); its "Gate A" is renamed `M9 Accounting Gate` in HTR canon; completed work preserved; pending work (PR4) maps to HTR-WP15 + HTR-WP21.

## Work-package ledger (23)

WP01 detail lives in the child plan `.cursor/plans/dee-415-htr-wp01-readiness-canon.plan.md` (and, once implemented, in the created canonical artifacts). This ledger tracks whole-program state; it is not the child execution contract.

## WP01 summary (COMPLETE — former HTR-B01 technical content)

HTR-WP01 is **COMPLETE** (WORK COMMIT `6600708`, Opus post-review PASS, validation PASS). It created the three canonical artifacts and recorded decisions/supersession (no runtime code):
- `docs/product-specs/ai-trader-historical-test-readiness-completion.md` — Completion Spec; `READY_FOR_FULL_HISTORICAL_TEST` = code-ready Execution Server package; gate groups CG-A..CG-H; explicit exclusions; decision record.
- `docs/gaps/ai-trader-historical-test-readiness-gap-registry.md` — HTR-GAP-001..042 with PRIMARY/CONTRIBUTING/CLOSURE (HTR-GAP-005 = WP04/WP22/WP22; no `B21'`).
- `docs/roadmaps/ai-trader-historical-test-readiness-roadmap.md` — 23 work packages `IB-HTR-01..23` with dependency graph incl. WP21→WP22→WP23 and WP16→WP22.
- Modify `docs/ai-trader/README.md` (discoverability pointer). Local commit: `DEE-415 docs(trader): establish historical-test readiness canon`.

## Execution rule

```text
No intermediate PRs.
No intermediate merges.
Every HTR-WPxx is implemented and validated locally on the same DEE-415 branch.
A single PR is opened only after HTR-WP23, final full validation, and the final Opus whole-program audit.
```

## WP-05 (current work package)

The active work package is **HTR-WP05** (Checkpoint/resume + pipeline DB-disconnect + terminal states), tracked in the rolling controller `.cursor/plans/dee-415-htr-wp04-wp12-runtime-substrate-rolling.plan.md` with **childPlanStatus REFRESH_REQUIRED**. **No HTR-WP05 packet is approved and Build is not authorized** — Opus must perform an in-place packet refresh against the actual WP04 CLOSEOUT HEAD before any Human approval. HTR-WP01 COMPLETE (`6600708`); HTR-WP02 COMPLETE (`7ec02dd`, HTR-GAP-030/034 closed); HTR-WP03 COMPLETE (`35283ed`, HTR-GAP-024 baseline recorded, OPEN, closure HTR-WP22); **HTR-WP04 COMPLETE** (WORK COMMIT `b3abe7b`, Opus post-review PASS, full validation PASS, streaming-evidence baseline at `replay-runs/RI-P7/htr-wp04-streaming-evidence-baseline/`; HTR-GAP-005 and HTR-GAP-026 remain OPEN with WP04 evidence recorded, closure HTR-WP22). This heading also satisfies the canonical-plan validator's `## WP-*` requirement.

## Acceptance (whole program)

`READY_FOR_FULL_HISTORICAL_TEST` is met when all gate groups CG-A..CG-H pass (measurable, evidence-backed), all 23 work packages are COMPLETE with local commits on the shared branch, the final Opus whole-program audit passes, the full validation matrix is green, the readiness package exists, and the Human Architect certifies (`CERTIFY-HTR-READY`, D-12). Per-work-package acceptance is defined in each child plan; the whole-program acceptance is conjunctive across all 23.

## Validation

Per work package: `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test --run && pnpm build` (+ `pnpm validate:canon` when canonical docs change; + CI `postgres-integration` when Postgres parity in scope) + Opus post-review where required. Full matrix + governance preflight (`./scripts/linear/preflight-pr-governance.sh`) run once before the single final PR. No campaign/M9/walk-forward/holdout/paper/live/Supabase/Cloudflare/Execution-Server command.

## STOP conditions

Approval-token mismatch; activation beyond research-only; Founders-reserved action required; verified canonical contradiction; missing standard; scope expansion beyond the active work package; any attempt to open a PR before WP23 + final audit; any attempt to create additional Linear issues, additional branches, or intermediate merges; validation failure unfixable within the active work package. On STOP: set `state.blockedReason`, report to Human; never push/merge.
